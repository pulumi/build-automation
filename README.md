# Automate Pulumi related Github Actions Workflows

Automation to keep Github Actions workflows up to date for Pulumi &amp; third-party 
repositories.

The initial code in this repository is migrated from pulumi/ci-mgmt and updated to be 
reusable for third parties like Pulumiverse, partners, etc. Most changes after the 
initial migration are aimed at a broader reuse of what is in this package.
